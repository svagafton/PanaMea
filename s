[31m-Account[m
[31m-Each member is required to set up an account upon registration, by specifying a user name and[m
[31m-password based on which to be uniquely identified in the system.[m
[31m-Exception to this rule are the lyndaKiosk Users (who don‚Äôt have to set up an account), for which the[m
[31m-validation is done based on their IP, and not based on the pair {user name + password}.[m
[31m-Also, for the lyndaCampus & lyndaEnterprise Users, the terminology used is profile instead of account.[m
[31m-Authorize.Net[m
[31m-It‚Äôs a payment gateway service provider used for processing the Credit Card transactions initiated[m
[31m-throughout lynda.com.[m
[31m-Billing Agreement[m
[31m-A Billing Agreement is an agreement that the buyer (our customer) accepts in the Express Checkout[m
[31m-Payment flow, through their PayPal account. Based on this, the merchant (lynda.com) can charge the[m
[31m-buyer in the future, without being necessary for the buyer to log in.[m
[31m-A Billing Agreement is automatically canceled when the subscription is canceled. It can also be canceled[m
[31m-by the user, in which case the PayPal job will fail to collect the payment on the next recurring billing date[m
[31m-(this leads to the customer‚Äôs account getting cancelled).[m
[31m-Billing Job[m
[31m-It‚Äôs an automated job (part of the Nightly Job), which handles the recurring payments in case of auto-[m
[31m-renewal accounts paid by Credit Card. It‚Äôs also responsible for expiring/renewing these accounts,[m
[31m-downgrades, and others additional actions needed to be performed upon user accounts.[m
[31m-Note: The Billing Job only processes Future Bills, overlooking Future Invoices which need to be manually[m
[31m-handled from the Admin site by the Customer Support/Sales representatives.[m
[31m-Bills[m
[31m-These documents are created only as future documents (and thus are actually called ‚Äúfuture bills‚Äù in[m
[31m-everyday talks), referring to an initial order as a base document. They are created only in case of auto-[m
[31m-renew accounts paid by Credit Card or PayPal, after the previous document (order, or future bill,[m
[31m-depending on the case) gets paid in full, and are due on the expiration date of the previous document.[m
[31m-Bills are always paid by Credit Card or PayPal, and always charged through Billing Job.[m
[31m-A bill can pass through the following statuses:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-    -   Open ‚Äì when first created[m
[31m-    -   Paid ‚Äì after the amount on the bill is captured by the Billing Job[m
[31m-    -   Problem ‚Äì in case the Billing Job fails to charge the customer‚Äôs Credit Card or PayPal account for[m
[31m-        the given amount[m
[31m-    -   Cancelled ‚Äì in case the user opt out of the subscription[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Documents[m
[31m-They can be considered as ‚Äòcontracts‚Äô between customers and lynda.com, used as a base for charging[m
[31m-customers accounts and for granting access to their accounts.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-An important characteristic of the lynda.com documents is that they can only contain a single product at[m
[31m-a time, excepting the Gift Subscriptions, which can appear several on a single document.[m

[31m-         the actual payment can be performed by check, money order or wire transfer)[m
[31m-    -    as future document in case of auto-renew accounts (called ‚Äúfuture invoices‚Äù in this case), when[m

[31m-[m
[31m-In case of future invoices, they are created only for auto-renew accounts that are paid by Purchase[m
